# Squeak

Squeak is a minimalistic Twitter clone developed as a personal project aimed at improving programming skills. It provides a simplified version of the popular social media platform, allowing users to post and interact with other users' posts.

### Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and securely log in to Squeak.
- Posting: Users can compose and publish short messages (1-280 characters).
- Timeline and User Profiles: Squeak offers a timeline to view the latest posts from all users and explore individual user profiles.
- Spam prevention: An individual user cannot post more than 3 times per minute.

### Technologies Used
Squeak is built using the following technologies and tools:

HTML, Tailwind, TypeScript, React.js and Next.js
Database: Prisma, PlanetScale, Axiom and Upstash
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management
Deployment: The application is hosted on Vercel.


### UPDATE
Planetscale (which was the database used for this project) retired their free plan which means the data is no longer accessible.
I don't feel like finding a new free database or upkeeping this further since it serves no purpose other than programming practice so this site will be pulled from deployment as well
